Carbonite Maps System

Most recently authored on Github by Rythal and a team of wonderful people, Carbonite is a mapping system for World of Warcraft
that bears a resemblance to Google Maps. You can use the mouse wheel over the map to zoom in or zoom out, set a destination,
track quest objectives, and many other things.

List of features
----------------
Warehouse       - Lists items from all of your characters (requires login on each/bank view)
Objectives      - Quest Objective tracker
Goto            - Set a destination on the map
Waypoint Arrow  - Points to your current destination
